# Spatial Modelling of Sea Cucumber quotas

This repository contains the code and data required to replicate the analyses in [Calderon-Aguilera, LE, Graham, LJ, Eigenbrod, F (2019) *Ignoring the spatial structure of the distributions of sea cucumbers when granting quotas can be costly*. Ocean & Coastal Management. 198: 104859](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104859). 

All analyses are documented in [sea_cucumber_spatial_hurdle.md](https://github.com/laurajanegraham/sea_cucumber/blob/master/sea_cucumber_spatial_hurdle.md).
