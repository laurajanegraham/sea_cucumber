This repository contains the code and data required to replicate the analyses in Calderon-Aguilera, LE, Graham, LJ, Eigenbrod, F (submitted) *Ignoring the spatial structure of the distributions of sea cucumbers when granting quotas can be costly*

All analyses are documented in [sea_cucumber_spatial_hurdle.md](github.com/laurajanegraham/sea_cucumber/sea_cucumber_spatial_hurdle.md).
